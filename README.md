# About me
I'm a programmer mostly as a hobby, school and my part-time job.
I create different projects ranging from just quality of life to big projects designed for commercial use.
I'm usually not very active on GitHub however you can contact me by discord where I'm very active: vk#3879 or by Telegram: @nnaem01

# My projects
The biggest projects I'm currently working on are "The Trade Hub" run by my friend, however I'm a programmer for him and my own project "Xenix Hub" which is designed to be a free script hub for the convince of others.
